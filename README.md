## COMMUNICATION DESIGN FOUNDATIONS: INTERACTION
PARSONS SCHOOL OF DESIGN: ART, MEDIA & TECHNOLOGY

https://courses.newschool.edu/courses/PSAM1028

In this course students will be introduced to programming as a creative mediumâ€” as a way of making and exploring. The coursework focuses on developing a vocabulary of interaction design principles which can then be applied across a range of platforms. Students are encouraged to experiment with various media, tools, and techniques, ultimately producing a portfolio of interactive and visual projects designed for the screen. An emphasis is placed on typography as it applies to a screen context, research-based problem solving and a learning-through-making approach to technical skill building. Historical and current interaction design precedents will be discussed. This course is intended for non-communication design majors, as an introduction to the discipline.
